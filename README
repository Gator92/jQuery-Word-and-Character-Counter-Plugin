This jQuery Word and character counter plug-in allows you to count characters or words, up or down. You can set a minimum or maximum goal for the counter to reach.

It will insert a div with an id of the name of the input area you are counting with a "_counter" suffix. For example, if the input you want to count is called "countMe", the id of the div that keeps track of the count will be "countMe_counter".

Simple? You bet your ass it is.
